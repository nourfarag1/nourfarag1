## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a Computer Engineering graduate working as a full-stack developer, with a strong focus on backend engineering.

Most of my work revolves around building backend systems using **.NET**, while also working with **Angular** on the frontend when needed. I enjoy designing scalable and maintainable systems, and I’m comfortable working with modern software architectures such as **CQRS**, **microservices**, and layered designs.

Currently, I’m part of a team building a **large multi-tenant B2B system**, where performance, reliability, and clean architecture are critical. I like understanding how things work under the hood and turning complex requirements into clean, practical solutions.
